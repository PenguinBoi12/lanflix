cp -r lanflix/ ~/.local/share/
```

2. Update the Service File

Edit the lanflix.service file and replace `<username>` with your actual username (e.g., penguinboi):
```bash
# change <username> to your username
WorkingDirectory=/home/<username>/.local/share/lanflix/app

3. Install the Service

Copy the modified service file to the systemd directory:

## ðŸŽ¬ Adding Movies
Place your movie folders in:
```
~/Videos/Medias/
```

Each movie must be inside its own folder. Within that folder:
- Only one .mp4 file is allowed
- Any number of subtitle files (.vtt) are supported
- (Optional) A poster.jpg image to display as the movie's cover in the UI

Example structure:
```
~/Videos/Medias/
â””â”€â”€ 2001: A Space Odyssey 1968/
    â”œâ”€â”€ 2001 a space odyssey 1080p.mp4
    â”œâ”€â”€ english.vtt
    â””â”€â”€ french.vtt
```
